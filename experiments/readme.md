This folder contains the results from several different experiments run by the scheduler on the xeon phi. For the most part, any file that ends in .log is an execution log, describing the decisions the runtime makes at any point in time for a single execution. Files that end in .csv tend to contain the condensed results across multiple experimental runs, either to construct a profile to make Pareto frontiers or as the results of comparing different scheduling methodologies.
