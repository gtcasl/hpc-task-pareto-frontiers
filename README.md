# HPC Task Pareto Frontiers

This repository contains the measurement infrastructure, measurements, and figures used in the analysis of tasks from task-graph based HPC applications. All measurements target the Intel MIC architecture and rely upon the power measurement facilities provided by MPSS. This project uses the [lwperf](github.com/gtcasl/lwperf) library to instrument the execution of the kernels.
